## Bookstore
Start by setting up a Node.js and Express.js server. 
You will also need to choose a SQL database management system to use. 
You can create the user interface using SASS and Typescript to add type safety.
 Finally, you can connect the front-end and back-end with RESTful APIs to create a fully functional online bookstore.
